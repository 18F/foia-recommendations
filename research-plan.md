# FOIA platform research plan

This is a living document. It will be updated over the course of the coming weeks as we learn more from our users and as we hone in our hypotheses.

## Background

Initial research on National FOIA Portal. Attempting to focus on speaking to user groups who were not heavily represented in previous FOIA 1.0 research.

The goal of this research is to inform hypotheses that address the following:
- How might we create a platform that improves the FOIA requesting experience?
- How might we make it easier for the agencies to respond to requests?
- How might various FOIA requesters benefit from a national FOIA platform?
- How might agency processes be improved or enhanced by a national FOIA platform?

## User groups

Prioritization is a function of how much insight I believe we have into a user group.

### Requesters

- Business/Industry (High priority)
- Attorneys (High priority)
- Individual one-off requesters (High priority)
- Civic society (Low priority)
- Journalists (Low priority)

### Agencies

- High volume
- Low volume
- Agencies using major FOIA platforms
- Home grown, manual FOIA system
- High security/high-side systems

### Software vendors

## Methods

- 45m interviews
- Journey map: Mapping how of agencies and requesters think the process works
- Service blueprint: Neutral map documenting current process from both agency and requester perspectives.
- Usability testing (once prototype is built)
- Contextual inquiry (if time allows): Observing a FOIA requester as they file a request, follow up on existing request, and receive their responsive documents
- Diary study (if time allows): Asking a set of users to log all FOIA related activities over the lifecycle of a request.

## Interview guide

Note: Avoid detailing project scope until after the interview is complete.

### Requesters
