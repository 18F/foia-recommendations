# FOIA platform research plan

This is a living document. It will be updated over the course of the coming weeks as we learn more from our users and as we hone in our hypotheses.

## Background

Initial research on National FOIA Portal. Attempting to focus on speaking to user groups who were not heavily represented in previous FOIA 1.0 research.

The goal of this research is to inform hypotheses that address the following:
- How might we create a platform that improves the FOIA requesting experience?
- How might we make it easier for the agencies to respond to requests?
- How might various FOIA requesters benefit from a national FOIA platform?
- How might agency processes be improved or enhanced by a national FOIA platform?

## User groups

### Requesters

- Business/Industry and regulated community
- Attorneys
- Individual first-time requesters
- Civic society
- Journalists
- University researchers

### Agencies and components

- High volume
- Low volume
- Agencies using major FOIA platforms (ex: FOIAOnline)
- Custom FOIA system
- Manual (ex: spreadsheets)
- High security systems

### Software vendors

## Methods

- 45m interviews
- Journey map: Mapping how of agencies and requesters think the process works
- Service blueprint: Neutral map documenting current process from both agency and requester perspectives.
- Usability testing (once prototype is built)
- Contextual inquiry (if time allows): Observing a FOIA requester as they file a request, follow up on existing request, and receive their responsive documents
- Diary study (if time allows): Asking a set of users to log all FOIA related activities over the lifecycle of a request.

## Interview guide

Note: Avoid detailing project scope until after the interview is complete.

### Requesters

- How often do you file FOIA requests?
- How do you decide to file a FOIA request?
- What are some things you do before filing a FOIA request?
- (If not addressed above: Do you search for existent publicly released documents before filing a FOIA request?)
- How do you identify which agency to submit your request
- How do you identify where to submit a request to an agency?
- How do you identify how to submit a request to an agency?
- Have you ever sent the same request to multiple agencies?
- How do you track the progress of your request?
- Have you experienced stalled requests? If so, what have you done in response?
- How often do you feel you've received what you were looking for at the end of the request process?
- What agencies have you interacted with that you have had a particular good experience with regard to FOIA?
- Have you ever had a particularly frustrating experience with a FOIA request? (Tell us about it)
- If you could wave a magic wand to address one issue in the FOIA space, what would that issue be?

### Agency


- Can you describe the steps involved in responding to a FOIA request?
  - What percent of your requests come in through paper mail, fax, email, web?
  - Does the format (paper mail, fax, email, web) affect how you handle it?
- What percentage of the requests you receive are:
  - For a record someone else has also requested?
  - Already publicly available?
  - Not perfected?
  - Should be directed elsewhere?
- How do you determine what documents will be published to a public reading room?
  - Are there any technical barriers to posting more documents online?
- If you could wave a magic wand to address one issue in the FOIA space, what would that issue be?
