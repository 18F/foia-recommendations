## Research Synthesis: Agencies

We are conducting research to write recommendations for the site referenced in last summer’s [FOIA Improvement Act](https://www.justice.gov/oip/oip-summary-foia-improvement-act-2016) that “allows a member of the public to submit a request for records… to any agency from a single website.” At a minimum, our work requires researching how to send requests to agencies in a way that fits into their existing processes and doesn’t add a delay or otherwise burden the process.
 
We’re especially interested in understanding how this can be done in a way that improves the system as a whole.

### What we were researching
The goal of our research is to inform hypotheses that address the following:
- How might we create a platform that improves the FOIA requesting experience?
- How might we make it easier for agencies to respond to requests?
- How might various FOIA requesters benefit from a national FOIA platform?
- How might agency processes be improved or enhanced by a national FOIA platform?

### What this document covers

#### Agencies
- A sample of federal agencies that respond to FOIA requests

### What this document doesn’t cover
- Requesters
- Vendors

### What we learned

#### Pain points 
Government FOIA teams are under-resourced for the level of effort required to respond
to FOIA requests in a timely manner. Additionally, new or infrequent requesters tend
to significantly underestimate the level of resources required for fulfilling
requests, especially broad ones.

#### High
- A lack of resources makes it difficult to fulfill requests in a timely manner,
especially for requests that require coordination across bureaucracies or expertise
for finding records and redacting them.
- Publishing documents publicly online can require significant additional time and resources, often due to hurdles related to coordinating with separate IT departments and ensuring Section 508 compliance.
- Current events can cause a spike in requests. These are often extremely broad, resource-intensive requests. For the agencies we spoke with, these requests usually constitute only about 5-10% of all requests, but they take up a majority of time and resources.

#### Medium
- Some requesters intentionally file extremely broad, vague, or nonspecific FOIA
requests (e.g., “anything and everything related to…”), but this makes finding
responsive documents difficult.
- When faced with broad requests, agencies often attempt to negotiate more finely
scoped requests that require less resources, which can occasionally result in an
antagonistic relationship between requesters and FOIA offices. These problematic
requesters are rare, but often account for a majority of time and resources.
- Of the agencies we spoke with, most are unhappy with the software tools needed to support FOIA requests.
- Receiving requests in paper format requires additional manual work.

#### Other learnings
- Some agencies have frequent requesters who account for a significant proportion of
their time and resources.
- Privacy is a concern for moving to a fully electronic submission-based system for
identification verification (currently done with signature) and document encryption
(often done with encrypted files on CDs).
- Of the agencies we spoke with, usually less than 5% of requests were for information that was already publicly available.
- Some agencies primarily receive requests almost exclusively for personal files.
