### What we were researching

The goal of our research is to inform hypotheses that address the following:
* How might we create a platform that improves the FOIA requesting experience?
* How might we make it easier for agencies to respond to requests?
* How might various FOIA requesters benefit from a national FOIA platform?
* How might agency processes be improved or enhanced by a national FOIA platform?

### What we learned

#### Pain points
Requesters who we spoke with often distrust the FOIA process and struggle with a lack of insight and understanding into what is happening from the time of submission to the receipt of a response from the agency. 
 
Requesters have little trust that their request won’t fall into a “black hole” unless they closely track and nudge it, that it’s being handled as quickly as possible, that searches are conducted exhaustively, and that redactions are made in good faith.
 
For these requesters, these concerns are significantly greater than the challenges related to submitting requests.

##### High
* Requesters have little insight into the process after submission
* The process takes a long time
* Requesters want access to individuals handling their request so they can check on status of the request or attempt to get their response more quickly
* Requesters report that time estimates are rarely accurate and requesters don’t place any value or meaning in them.
* Lack of trust in redactions. Perception of incomplete disclosure.

##### Medium
The submission process is inconsistent between agencies
the submission mechanism/format varied (email vs web form vs fax vs USPS)
complicated request requirements above what’s in the statute
frustration with the amount of information required by many agencies
significant distrust in reasons for request requirements beyond information required in the statute
lack of understanding about the regulatory process behind request requirements
The mechanism/format of request response is frustrating
Many requesters prefer the highest degree of anonymity possible. Some use tools like MuckRock or hire third parties to file requests on their behalf.
Lack of trust for reasons behind friction in the process: requesters are dubious about whether differences in submission and response formats and requirements are due to technical limitations or by design.
Other learnings
Many requesters expressed a desire to be able to search through more government records, but what is public is often used to hone in searches, not to replace them.
The requesters we spoke to understand that FOIA offices are under-staffed and/or under-resourced. They often prefer to have a good relationship with FOIA officers as opposed to an antagonistic one. If they have easy access to an attorney, they are inclined to appeal or bring lawsuits when other avenues are exhausted.
No requesters in the groups we spoke with struggled to discover where to submit requests, but importantly, we have not yet interviewed first-time requesters.
Requesters often build their own work-around processes like spreadsheets or even apps to track their requests and deadlines so they can follow up with agencies.
