The RESTORE Act calls for a regional approach to restoring the long-term health of the valuable natural ecosystem and economy of the Gulf Coast region. The RESTORE Act dedicates 80 percent of civil and administrative penalties paid under the Clean Water Act, after the date of enactment, by responsible parties in connection with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund (Trust Fund) for ecosystem restoration, economic recovery, and tourism promotion in the Gulf Coast region. This effort is in addition to the restoration of natural resources injured by the spill that is being accomplished through a separate Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) (link is external) under the Oil Pollution Act. A third and related Gulf restoration effort is being administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) (link is external) using funds from the settlement of criminal charges against BP and Transocean Deepwater, Inc. \n\nIn addition to creating the Trust Fund, the RESTORE Act established the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (Council). The Council is currently chaired by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and includes the Governors of the States of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, and the Secretaries of the U.S. Departments of Army, Commerce, Homeland Security, and the Interior, and the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.","name":"Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council"}},"General Services Administration ( GSA )":{"address":{"address_lines":["FOIA Contact","FOIA Requester Service Center (H1C)","Room 7308"],"city":"Washington","state":"DC","street":"1800 F.
