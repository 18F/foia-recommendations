## What is FOIA?

The U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, for short) allows the public the
right to request access to government records.

Under FOIA, government agencies are required to disclose requested information
unless it falls under one of nine exemptions that protect interests such as
personal privacy, national security, and law enforcement.
