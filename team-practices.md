# FOIA Discovery Team Practices

This document describes the conventions the FOIA Discovery team has agreed to work under.

## Sprints

We do one-week sprints, with a retro and planning meeting every Monday. We have daily standups
with our 18F team, and daily standups with the DOJ team.

## Issues

We use Github + Zenhub for issue tracking. We create issues as necessary to capture stories
and articulate requirements for specific tasks. Our kanban categories for describing the state of
issues are:
 * New
 * Backlog
 * In Progress
 * Review / QA
 * Closed

## Pull Requests

All code changes should happen through pull requests (PRs).
New PRs should be assigned to the person who opens the PR.
All PRs should be reviewed by one other team member.
When a PR has an accepted review, either the reviewer or the owner (assignee)
may merge the PR using either the `Squash and merge` or the `Rebase and merge`
Github big green button. Each PR should result in exactly 1 commit to the `master`
branch.
